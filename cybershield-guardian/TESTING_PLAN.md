- Verify user roles and permissions enforcement

## Integration Testing

- Test JWT authentication flow end-to-end
- Validate database CRUD operations for all models

## Testing Tools

- Use browser developer tools for frontend testing
- Use MongoDB Compass or CLI for database verification

## Next Steps
- Perform critical-path testing focusing on user auth and main pages
- Perform thorough testing covering all endpoints and UI interactions
- Report any bugs or issues for fixing before feature implementation
